# rfc4716

rfc4716 is a library for generating [RFC4716](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4716) compliant SSH2 public keys

## Usage

You can use this package like any other Go package, but I recommend just copying the function. Remember: [A little copying is better than a little dependency](https://go-proverbs.github.io/).
